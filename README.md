# Steam APP Clone
 
 This project is only for learning purposes carried out without the help of courses/tutorials.
 As I am trying to use copyright-free images, just out of habit, the clone cannot be perfect, but it is possible to get confused as these small details are only noticed when the original and the clone are placed side by side.

 
### Technologies used:
* HTML5
*CSS3
* JavaScript

It's worth remembering that this is just a clone of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/about/">STEAM</a> desktop application.
